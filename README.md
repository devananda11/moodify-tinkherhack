# **Moodify**

## **Project Overview**
Ever wanted someone to make you a Spotify playlist?...or maybe you tried to make one for yourself but ended up choosing songs from your liked list cause you didn't know any better ones. Well, this is for you guys (like us) who want to take their playlist to another level. Just let Moodify know your mood and our AI-powered system will fetch out a list of songs for **you**. Curate and adjust the songs to your liking and press the Create Playlist button. The playlist is now up and running on your Spotify account!

## **Main Functionalities**
- **Spotify Authentication**: Users log in using their **Spotify account**.
- **Mood Analysis**: Users enter how they feel, and the app analyzes their emotion using **Hugging Face RoBERTa API**.
- **Song Recommendations**: Based on the mood detected, the app fetches **recommended songs** via **RapidAPI**.
- **Playlist Management**:
  - Users can remove suggested songs before finalizing their playlist.
  - Users can save the final selection directly to **Spotify**.
